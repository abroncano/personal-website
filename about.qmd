I am a current graduate student from Columbus, OH. I attended Case Western Reserve University and obtained my BS in Biology in 2022. I enjoyed CWRU and Cleveland so much that I wanted to continue my education here for graduate school, and I am currently in the second year of my program in the Pathology Department. I have always loved learning, and desire to become a researcher who investigates underlying causes of diseases at the molecular level. I am particularly interested in understanding the role of estrogen in modulating immuno-protective functions of T cells. My goal is to better understand these processes in order to drive further research into investigating autoimmune diseases.
