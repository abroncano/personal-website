# Welcome to my website!

Hi, I'm Alyssia (she/her), thanks for checking out my website! I'm looking forward to connecting with you!


# About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in the Pathology Department at Case Western Reserve University. My research focuses on studying how steroid sex hormones affect adaptive immune responses, specifically by investigating the role of estrogen on T cell development and functionality.

Outside of my research, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and visiting museums. I also have four very spoiled cats!

Please [contact me](mailto:avb44@case.edu) if you are interested in talking about science!
